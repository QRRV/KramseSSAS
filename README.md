## Overview
KramseSSAS is a project dedicated to analyzing, transforming, processing, and saving shipping data using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). This repository leverages SSAS cubes to deliver high-performance data processing and analytics capabilities tailored for complex shipping datasets.

## Framework and Technologies
The project is built using:
- **SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS)** for building and managing multidimensional and tabular data models.
- **SSAS Cubes** to enable fast data retrieval and storage, facilitating efficient querying and multidimensional analysis of large shipping data sets.

## Cloning

1. Git clone:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/QRRV/KramseSSAS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd KramseSSAS
   ```

## Features
- **Multidimensional and Tabular Models**: Supports both multidimensional (OLAP) and tabular models for flexibility in data analysis.
- **Efficient Data Storage**: SSAS cubes allow high-performance querying on large datasets, optimizing shipping data processing.
- **Advanced Shipping Data Analytics**: Perform analytics on data dimensions such as shipping routes, costs, and time metrics, enabling deeper insights into logistical efficiency.
